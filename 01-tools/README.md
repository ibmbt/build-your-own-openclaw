# Step 01: Give your agent a tool.

> Simple tools are more powerful than you think. Read, Write, Bash is enough.

## Prerequisites

Same as Step 00 - copy the config file and add your API key:

```bash
cp default_workspace/config.example.yaml default_workspace/config.user.yaml
# Edit config.user.yaml to add your API key
```

## What We will Build?

Giving the agent the ability to actually *do* things, from chatting only to taking real actions.

## Key Components

- **Stop Reason**: Chat loop branches on `stop_reason` — `"tool_calls"` to execute tools, `"stop"` for normal completion, `"length"` for truncated responses
- **Tools**: Manages available tools and executes tool calls
- **Tool Calling Loop**: Agent calls tools, adds results to history, continues conversation

```python
class BaseTool(ABC):
    name: str
    description: str
    parameters: dict[str, Any]

    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, session: "AgentSession", **kwargs: Any) -> str:
        pass

    def get_tool_schema(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": self.name,
                "description": self.description,
                "parameters": self.parameters,
            },
        }
```

Integrating Tools into Chat Loop.

```python
class AgentSession:
    async def chat(self, message: str) -> str:
        user_msg: Message = {"role": "user", "content": message}
        self.state.add_message(user_msg)

        tool_schemas = self.tools.get_tool_schemas()
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        while True:
            messages = self.state.build_messages()
            content, tool_calls, stop_reason = await self.agent.llm.chat(messages, tool_schemas)

            assistant_msg: Message = {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": content,
                "tool_calls": [...],
            }
            self.state.add_message(assistant_msg)

            if stop_reason == "tool_calls":
                await self._handle_tool_calls(tool_calls)
                continue

            if stop_reason == "length":
                logger.warning(
                    "LLM response truncated (max_tokens reached), "
                    "returning partial response"
                )

            break

        return content
```


## Notes

### Why Tools Are Hardcoded

Tools are registered via `ToolRegistry.with_builtins()` in Python, not declared in `AGENT.md` frontmatter.

YAML-based tool config involves design decisions beyond the scope of this tutorial. The `BaseTool` abstraction already keeps tools pluggable in code.

OpenClaw handles this with a plugin system and per-agent JSON config — but that's out of scope for this tutorial.

## Try it out

```bash
cd 01-tools
uv run my-bot chat

# # Step 01: Tools - Read, Write, Bash is Powerful Enough

# Give the agent the ability to execute tools (read, write, edit, bash) and interact with the filesystem.
